# Quiz-Maker
WIP single-page application that allows users to craft their own web quiz without requiring prior programming knowledge.  First iteration of the app is complete.  Feel free to download the files and try it for yourself.  Make sure to save all files in the same folder and open index.html into your browser.  The current navigation bar in the app serves no current function.

Please note that **Firefox and Microsoft Edge are the only browsers** I currently know that support local Ajax calls on files, so the app currently only works on those browsers.

# Short-term goals
1.  Add input box for the user to choose rgb values manually.
2.  Debug possible scenarios that can cause the app to crash.
