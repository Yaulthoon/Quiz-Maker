# Quiz-Maker
Single-page application that allows users to craft their own web quiz without requiring prior programming knowledge.  First iteration of the app is complete.  Feel free to download the files and try it for yourself.  Make sure to save all files in the same folder and open index.html into your browser.  For FAQ purposes, please refer to the about.html file.

Please note that **Firefox and Microsoft Edge are the only browsers** I currently know that support local Ajax calls on files, so the app currently only works on those browsers.
